                            <p>What happens after a death of a TFSA holder will vary according to the  situation. It is important to be aware of the following items in order to&nbsp; understand what the potential tax implications may be.</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>The type of TFSA</li>
                              <li>The type of  beneficiary(ies)</li>
                              <li>Whether any income was  earned after the date of death</li>
                              <li>How long, after the  date of death, before amounts are distributed to beneficiaries</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Depending on how the items above apply to your situation, they may affect  the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Whether the deceased's  TFSA continues to exist or is considered to have ended</li>
                              <li>How income earned  after the date of death can be reported and taxed</li>
                              <li>Whether a beneficiary  can contribute amounts they receive to their own TFSA, and whether the  contribution would affect their available TFSA contribution room</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h2>Different types of beneficiaries </h2>
                            <p>TFSAs can have 2 types of beneficiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &lt;dl – horiz without border&gt;<br>
  <strong>Successor holder</strong>             A  survivor who has been designate as a successor holder of the TFSA<br>
  <strong>Designated beneficiary </strong>                A survivor (who is not a  successor holder), children, former spouses or common law partners, and  qualified donees &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &lt;/dl&gt;<br>
                              Determining the type of beneficiary is the first important  step. The type of beneficiary can be determined by:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Designations  that the deceased holder may have made in their TFSA contract</li>
                              <li>Terms of the deceased holder's will (if there is  one)</li>
                              <li>Succession legislation in the province or  territory of the deceased holder&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>TFSA holders who want to change a beneficiary designation  they made in the past should contact their TFSA issuer. <br>
                              For more information:</p>

                            <h3>Beneficiary designation in Quebec </h3>
                            <p>Quebec does not recognize&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the designation of successor holder or beneficiary.  However, a surviving spouse or common-law partner in Quebec may still benefit  from the exempt  contribution &nbsp;process.  <br>
                              Survivors in Quebec may make  exempt contributions   &lt;xh&gt;<br>
                              Quebec survivors may contribute the amounts they receive to their  own TFSA without affecting their unused contribution room if:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>the amounts are paid to the survivor no later  than December 31 of the year following the date of death</li>
                              <li>the survivor files a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc240.html">Designation  of an Exempt Contribution TFSA (RC240)</a>  within 30 days of making the contribution</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>For more information: Beneficiaries who are survivors [H3 on <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/if-tfsa-holder-dies/if-you-are-a-beneficiary-of-a-tfsa.html">If  you are a designated beneficiary</a>] <br>
  &lt;/xh&gt;<br>
  &nbsp;If there are no  beneficiaries<strong> </strong><br>
                              If there is no successor holder or beneficiary designated in  the TFSA contract or will, the TFSA property/assets is directed to the deceased holder&rsquo;s estate and is distributed according  to the terms of the will.   </p>

                                <p>&nbsp;Using &quot;in  order to&quot; intentionally. While shortening this to just &quot;to&quot; is  usually a plain language recommendation, in this instance I see it as necessary  for understanding and clarity -- particularly given the mental/emotional state  of the user.</p>

                                <p>&nbsp;Thinking about  these terms I wonder if &quot;designated&quot; could benefit from a plain  language description? This section makes sense to me, but I wonder if we might  have to be more clear for folks who may not have any experience with terms like  these?</p>

                                <p>&nbsp;I hear you but I  hesitate to replace it as I think it's a legal term used in TFSA contracts and  wills. We can confirm this in the <strong>CoDe2</strong>. My understanding: both SH and  and designated beneficiaries and &quot;types&quot; of beneficiary. And they are  both &quot;designated&quot; in the TFSA contract or will. To distinguish  &quot;beneficiary&quot; (the umbrella term) from the 2 distinct types, I tried  to keep the language consistent. BUT if we can simplify, then we will.</p>

                                <p>&nbsp;SME recommends  we be careful in explaining why QC doesn't recognize it and maybe point to QC  legislation. I'm not sure we need to provide a reason. </p>

                                  For Quebec holders: Your spouse will be able to deposit the  amounts received in his or her own TFSA without affecting their unused  contribution room. However, two conditions must be met to be entitled to this  benefit:<br>
                                  – Payment of the amounts must be made no later than December  31 of the year following your death;<br>
                                  – Within 30 days following the date of contribution to their  TFSA, your surviving spouse must file the form&nbsp;<em>Designation of an Exempt  Contribution to a Survivor Tax‑Free Savings Account (TFSA)</em>&nbsp;with the  Canada Revenue Agency. The form is available on the Agency&rsquo;s website.<br>

                                <p>&nbsp;I think we  should go with what the SME recommends and link out to the official Quebec  legislation. The heading makes sense so folks from Quebec can easily find the  right section on this page, but link out from there </p>
