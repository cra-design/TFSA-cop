                            <h2 id="toc1">What is a successor holder </h2>
                            <p>A successor holder is the survivor of  the deceased who is named as the new holder of the TFSA in the TFSA contract or  will of the deceased holder.</p>
                            <p>The successor holder immediately becomes the new holder and  assumes ownership of the TFSA upon the death of the deceased holder.</p>
                              <p>The deceased holder is not considered to receive an amount  from their TFSA at the time of death. Instead, the TFSA continues to exist. Its  value at the date of death and any income earned after that date are still sheltered  from tax under the new successor holder.</p>
                              <p>The TFSA issuer will inform the CRA of the change in  ownership.</p>

                              <details>
                              <summary>Example of a successor holder</summary>
                              <p>Ginette and her husband Paul are both residents and live in a province that  recognizes TFSA beneficiary designations. Ginette is the holder of a TFSA and  has designated Paul as the successor holder.</p>
                              <p>Ginette dies on February 15, 2024. The fair market value (FMV) of her TFSA  on that date is $10,000. There is no excess TFSA amount in her account. Her  estate is finally settled on September 1, 2024.  By that time, an additional $200 of income has been earned.</p>
                              <p>Since Paul  meets all the conditions, he becomes the successor  holder of Ginette&rsquo;s TFSA on the date of death.</p>
                              <p>The FMV of $10,000 on the date of death is not taxable to Paul. The $200 of income  earned after the date of death (and any subsequent income earned) is also not  taxable to Paul.</p>
                                  <p>Because Ginette was a resident at the time of her death and lived in a province that recognizes TFSA beneficiary designations, the CRA will not issue a T4A slip and will not require a Designation of an  Exempt Contribution – TFSA (Form RC240).</p>
                              
                              </details>

                            <h3>How contribution room is affected</h3>
                            <p>If the successor holder already has their own TFSA, they would  be considered to hold two separate TFSAs.</p>
                              <p>The successor holder's own available TFSA  contribution room is not affected by becoming the successor holder if there is no excess amount on the deceased  holder&rsquo;s TFSA. See below for details <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/if-tfsa-holder-dies/if-you-are-a-beneficiary-of-a-tfsa.html#toc2">if  there is an excess amount.</a></p>
                              <p>The successor holder may ask the TFSA issuer to directly  transfer some or all of the value from one TFSA to the other and consolidate  the accounts. This would be a qualifying transfer and would not affect  their available TFSA contribution room.</p>
                              <p>For more information: <a href="">Requesting a  TFSA transfer</a></p>
                              <p>After taking over ownership of the deceased holder's TFSA, the successor holder can make  tax‑free withdrawals from that account. They can also make new contributions to that account if they have available contribution room.</p>
                           
                            <h3>If the successor is named in the will </h3>
                            <p>If the successor holder is designated in the will, it must state  that the successor holds all the same rights as the original holder. This includes  the right to cancel or change any beneficiary designation the deceased holder  had chosen for the account or its assets.</p>

                            <h3>If the TFSA is a trust arrangement</h3>
                            <p>If the TFSA contract is a trust arrangement, the trust  continues to be the legal owner of the property held in the TFSA.</p>

                            <h3>Holders must have a social insurance number or individual tax number</h3>
                            <p>In some cases, a survivor who is designated as the successor  holder may not have a valid <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-address-information/social-insurance-number.html">social  insurance number (SIN)</a>, which is a requirement for opening a TFSA.</p>
                              <p>If the survivor is a resident of Canada, they should apply to  Service Canada for a valid Canadian SIN.<br>
                              For more information or to apply for a SIN:  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html">Social  Insurance Number (Service Canada)</a></p>
                              <p>If the survivor is a <strong>non-resident</strong>, they should apply for an  individual tax number (ITN) by completing the following:<br>
                              <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1261.html">Application  for a CRA Individual Tax Number (ITN) for Non-Residents (Form T1261)</a></p>
                            
                            <h2 id="toc2">Excess amounts may be taxable </h2>
                            <p>An excess amount can occur when a TFSA holder contributes  more than their available contribution room allows. If the deceased holder&rsquo;s  TFSA contains an excess amount at the time of death, there may be tax implications.</p>
                              <p>Any excess amount is taxable to the deceased holder at a  rate of <strong> 1% per month</strong>  on the highest excess amount for each month it stays in  the account, up to and including the month of death. </p>
                              <p>At the beginning of the month after the date of death, the  successor holder  is considered to make a contribution to their TFSA that is equal to the excess amount that was in  the deceased holder&rsquo;s account.</p>
                              <p>If that contribution creates an excess amount in the  successor holder&rsquo;s account, it is taxable at a rate of <strong> 1% per month</strong> on the  highest amount for as long as the excess remains in the account.</p>
                              <p>The deceased holder&rsquo;s legal representative must file the following forms for that period regardless of  whether the contribution creates an excess in the successor holder&rsquo;s account or not.</p>

                            <ul>
                              <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc243.html">Form  RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return</a></li>

                            <details>
                            <summary>Example: How an excess amount may not be taxable</summary>
                              <p>Miriam and Pauline are a married couple. They both have TFSAs and have designated each other as successor holder of each others' accounts.</p>
                                <p>At the beginning  of 2025, they each have an available TFSA contribution room of $7,000. Miriam contributes $7,000 to her TFSA, and Pauline  contributes $1,500 to hers.</p>
                              <p>On June 12, 2025, Miriam contributes an additional  $2,000 to her TFSA, bringing her total contributions for 2025 to $9,000.</p>
                              <p>As Miriam only has contribution room of $7,000 for 2025, she now has an excess TFSA amount of $2,000.</p>
                              <p>Miriam passes away on September 18, 2025, and the value of  her TFSA on that date is $9,000. As Pauline meets all the conditions to be a successor holder,  she becomes the new holder of the TFSA from September 18, 2025.</p>
                              <p>Because there is an excess amount in Miriam&rsquo;s TFSA at the  time of her death, Pauline is deemed to make, on October 1, 2025, a $2,000  contribution to her TFSA (which is the excess amount in Miriam&rsquo;s TFSA).</p>
                              <p>But because Pauline had previously only contributed $1,500  to her own TFSA, she still has $5,500 of unused contribution room available for  2025. As a result, the $2,000 deemed contribution does not create an excess TFSA  amount in her account.</p>
                              <p>Therefore, there are no tax consequences to Pauline based on  this contribution. Her unused contribution room for the rest of 2025 is  $3,500.</p>

                            <summary>Example: How an excess amount may be taxable</summary>
                              <p>In the example above, if Pauline had initially  contributed $7,000 to her own TFSA on May 10, 2025, (instead of the $1,500  previously noted), the $2,000 deemed contribution on October 1, 2025, would  have resulted in a total 2025 contribution of $9,000.</p>
                              <p>Pauline&rsquo;s TFSA contribution room at the beginning of 2025  was $7,000. As a result of the deemed contribution, she would be considered to  have an excess TFSA amount of $2,000 ($9,000-$7,000). </p>
                              <p>In this situation, Pauline would be subject to a tax of 1%  per month on this excess TFSA amount for as long as it remained in her account.</p>
