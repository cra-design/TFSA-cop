                            <h2>What is a successor holder </h2>
                            <p>A successor holder is the survivor &nbsp;of  the deceased who is named as the new holder of the TFSA in the TFSA contract or  will of the deceased holder. <br>
                              The successor holder immediately becomes the new holder and  assumes ownership of the TFSA upon the death of the deceased holder. <br>
                              The deceased holder is not considered to receive an amount  from their TFSA at the time of death. Instead, the TFSA continues to exist. Its  value at the date of death and any income earned after that date are still sheltered  from tax under the new successor holder. <br>
                              The TFSA issuer will inform the CRA of the change in  ownership.<br>
                              Example of a successor holder &lt;xh&gt;<br>
                              Ginette and her husband Paul lived in a province that  recognizes a TFSA beneficiary designation. Ginette was the holder of a TFSA and  designated Paul as the successor holder. <br>
                              Ginette died on February 15, 2024. The value of her TFSA  on that date was $10,000. There was no excess TFSA amount in her account. Her  estate was finally settled on September 1, 2024&nbsp;.  By that time, an additional $200 of income had been earned. <br>
                              Since Paul met all the conditions, he became the successor  holder of Ginette&rsquo;s TFSA as of the date of her death. <br>
                              The fair market value (FMV&nbsp;)  of $10,000 as of the date of death is not taxable to Paul. The $200 of income  earned after the date of death (and any subsequent income earned) is also not  taxable to Paul. No T4A slip would be issued and Form RC240, Designation of an  Exempt Contribution –Tax‑Free Savings Account (TFSA), is not required in this  situation. <br>
                              This is because Ginette was a resident, at the time of her  death, in a province that recognizes TFSA beneficiary designations. <br>
  &lt;/xh&gt;</p>
                            <h3>How contribution room is affected</h3>
                            <p>If the successor holder already has their own TFSA, they would  be considered to hold 2 separate accounts. <br>
                              The successor holder's own unused/available TFSA  contribution room is not affected by becoming a successor holder if there is no excess amount on the deceased  holder&rsquo;s TFSA.&nbsp;  However, see below for details <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/if-tfsa-holder-dies/if-you-are-a-beneficiary-of-a-tfsa.html#toc2">if  there is an excess amount.</a>   <br>
                              The successor holder may ask the TFSA issuer to directly  transfer some or all of the value from one TFSA to the other and consolidate  the accounts. This would be a qualifying transfer and would not affect  their available TFSA contribution room&nbsp;. <br>
                              For more information: <a href="https://Link">Requesting a  TFSA transfer</a><br>
                              After taking over ownership, the successor holder can make  tax‑free withdrawals from that account. They can also make new contributions to  that account depending on their own unused TFSA contribution room.</p>
                            <h3>If the successor is named in the will </h3>
                            <p>If the successor holder is designated in the will, it must state  that the successor holds all the same rights as the original holder. This includes  the right to cancel or change any beneficiary designation the deceased holder  had chosen for the account or its assets.  &nbsp;</p>
                            <h3>If the TFSA is a trust arrangement</h3>
                            <p>If the TFSA contract is a trust arrangement, the trust  continues to be the legal owner of the property held in the TFSA.</p>
                            <h3>Successors must have a social insurance number or individual tax number</h3>
                            <p>In some cases, a survivor who is designated as the successor  holder may not have a valid <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-address-information/social-insurance-number.html">social  insurance number (SIN)</a>, which is a requirement for opening a TFSA.  <br>
                              If the survivor is a resident of Canada, they should apply to  Service Canada for a valid Canadian SIN. <br>
                              For more information or to apply for a SIN:  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html">Social  Insurance Number (Service Canada)</a><br>
                              If the survivor is a non-resident, they should apply for an  individual tax number (ITN) by completing an:<br>

                            <h2>If there is an excess amount </h2>
                            <p>An excess amount can occur when a TFSA holder contributes  more than their available contribution room allows. If the deceased holder&rsquo;s  TFSA contains an excess amount at the time of death, there are tax implications.<br>
                              Any excess amount is taxable to the deceased holder at a  rate of 1% per month on the highest excess amount for each month it stays in  the account, up to and including the month of death. <br>
                              At the beginning of the month after the date of death, the  successor holder  is considered to have made a contribution that is equal to the excess amount in  the deceased holder&rsquo;s account&nbsp;.<br>
                              If that contribution creates an excess amount in the  successor holder&rsquo;s account, it is taxable at a rate of 1% per month on the  highest amount for as long as the excess remains in the account.<br>
                              The deceased holder&rsquo;s legal representative must file&nbsp; the following forms for that period regardless of  whether the contribution creates an excess in the successor holder&rsquo;s account or  not.</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc243.html">Form  RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return</a></li>

                            </ul>
                    <p>Example: When the successor  holder does not owe tax &lt;xh&gt;<br>
                              Miriam and Pauline were a married couple. At the beginning  of 2025, each had available TFSA contribution room of $7,000. <br>
                              Miriam contributed $7,000 to her TFSA, and Pauline  contributed $1,500 to hers. <br>
                              Then on June 12, 2025, Miriam contributed an additional  $2,000 to her TFSA, bringing her total contributions for 2025 to $9,000.<br>
                              As Miriam only had contribution room of $7,000 for 2025, she  had an excess TFSA amount of $2,000.<br>
                              Miriam passed away on September 18, 2025, and the value of  her TFSA on that date was $9,000. Miriam had named Pauline as the successor  holder of her TFSA. As Pauline met all the conditions to be a successor holder,  she became the holder of the TFSA from September 18, 2025.<br>
                              Since an excess TFSA amount remained in Miriam&rsquo;s TFSA at the  time of her death, Pauline is deemed to have made, on October 1, 2025, a $2,000  contribution to her TFSA (which is the excess amount in Miriam&rsquo;s TFSA). <br>
                              But because Pauline had previously only contributed $1,500  to her own TFSA, she still had $5,500 of unused contribution room available for  2025. As a result, the $2,000 deemed contribution did not create an excess TFSA  amount in her account.<br>
                              Therefore, there are no tax consequences to Pauline based on  this contribution. Her unused contribution room for the rest of 2025 is  $3,500.  <br>
  &lt;/xh&gt;<br>
                              Example: When the successor  holder owes tax&lt;xh&gt;<br>
                              From the situation above, if Pauline had initially  contributed $7,000 to her own TFSA on May 10, 2025, (instead of the $1,500  previously noted), the $2,000 deemed contribution on October 1, 2025, would  have resulted in a total 2025 contribution of $9,000.<br>
                              Pauline&rsquo;s TFSA contribution room at the beginning of 2025  was $7,000. As a result of the deemed contribution, she would be considered to  have an excess TFSA amount of $2,000 ($9,000-$7,000). <br>
                              In this situation, Pauline would be subject to a tax of 1%  per month on this excess TFSA amount for as long as it remained in her account.<br>
  &lt;/xh&gt;<br>
