<h2 id="toc1">When to make a contribution</h2>

<p>If you have  available contribution room and are a resident of Canada, you may contribute  funds to your TFSA at any time during the calendar year. </p>

<h3>Make sure you have available room </h3>

<p>Your contribution  room can change when you make withdrawals and contributions. Always calculate  your available contribution room <strong>before </strong>you contribute.</p>
<p>For more  information:  <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributing-to-a-tfsa/calculate-your-tfsa-contribution-room.html#toc1">Calculate your room  before you contribute</a></p>
<p>If you become a  non-resident, do not contribute to your TFSA.</p>

<p>For more  information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributing-to-a-tfsa/before-you-contribute.html#toc4">Do not contribute  if you are a non-resident</a>   </li>
  <li><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/if-you-become-non-resident.html">How non-residency  affects your TFSA</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc2">How to make a contribution</h2>
<p>To contribute funds to your TFSA, contact the financial institution that  issued it. You can contribute to you TFSA at any time during the year, provided  you have the available contribution room.</p>
<p>The amount that you contribute will immediately be applied against your  available contribution room and reduce it by the same amount you contributed. </p>

<h2 id="toc3">How to avoid an over-contribution</h2>
<p>Do not contribute more than your available contribution room allows. If you  over-contribute, the excess amount is taxable at a rate of 1% per month for as  long as the excess amount remains in the account. For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributing-to-a-tfsa/what-to-do-if-you-contribute-too-much.html">If you  over-contribute to a TFSA</a></p>

<h3>Track your contribution room yourself</h3>
<p>We recommend calculating your available contribution  yourself using your own records. Neither your financial institution nor the CRA  necessarily has your complete TFSA information.<br>
  For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributing-to-a-tfsa/calculate-your-tfsa-contribution-room.html#toc1">Calculate your room before you contribute</a></p>

<h3>Do not replace a withdrawal in the same year&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Never replace or repay a withdrawal in the same calendar year you made  it, unless you know that you have enough unused contribution room available.</p>
<p>Contributions you make are immediately applied against your available  contribution room, reducing your available room by the amount you contribute. But  withdrawals from your TFSA do not create new available room until the <strong>next </strong>calendar  year.</p>

<details>
<summary>Example&nbsp;: Repaying contributions in the same year may lead  to over-contribution</summary>

<p>On January 1, 2025, Taylor&rsquo;s available TFSA contribution room for the  year is <strong>$6,500</strong>.</p>
<p>During the year, she makes the following transactions.</p>
<p>On January 10, 2025, she contributes $2,000. This contribution is  immediately applied against her available room, reducing it to <strong>$4,500 </strong>(6,500-2,000). </p>
<p>On February 10, 2025, she withdraws $2,000. Her contribution room stays  at<strong> $4,500</strong>. (The $2,000 room will be added back next year.) </p>
<p>On March 10, 2025, she contributes $2,000. Her contribution room immediately  reduces to <strong>$2,500</strong> (4,500-2,000). </p>
<p>On April 10, 2025, she withdraws $1,000. Her contribution room stays at<strong> $2, 500</strong>. (The $1,000 room will be added back next year.) </p>
<p>On Dec 31,2025, she contributes $6,500. Because she only has $2,500 room  available, she has over-contributed by <strong>$4,000.</strong></p>
<p>In 2025, her contributions added up as follows: $2000 + $2,000 + $6500 =  $10,500.</p>
<p>In this example, she over-contributed and have exceeded her available  contribution room for 2025 of $6,500 by $4,000.</p>

</details>

<h3>Investment  losses do not create contribution room</h3>
<p>Changes in the value of your TFSA  investments do not affect your TFSA contribution room.</p>

<p>If your TFSA contains an investment that loses value, the loss does not  count as a withdrawal.  An investment  loss is <strong>not </strong>added back as<strong> </strong>available contribution room the next  year.</p>

<details>
<summary>Example: Do not replace an investment loss</summary>

<p>At the beginning of 2025, Sam&rsquo;s available TFSA contribution room is <strong>$6,500.</strong></p>
<p>During the year, he does the following transactions.   </p>
<ul>
  <li>On January 10, 2025, he  contributes <strong>$6,500</strong>. He invests these funds in ABC stock.  </li>
  <li>Over the year, ABC  stock loses value. </li>
  <li>On Dec 29, 2025, his  investment is now worth $3,000. </li>
  <li>On Dec 31, 2025, he contributes <strong>$3,000</strong> to bring his balance back up to $6,500.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s contributions for the year add up as follows: $6,500 + $3,000 =  $9,500   <br>
  Because Same&rsquo;s available room for the year was $6,500, he  over-contributed by $3,000.</p>
</details>


<h3>Do not over-contribute to multiple TFSAs</h3>
<p>If you have multiple TFSAs, your available contribution room applies to  all of them combined. To avoid over-contributing, be sure to track your transactions  for all your accounts before making a contribution.<br>
  For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributing-to-a-tfsa/calculate-your-tfsa-contribution-room.html#toc1">Calculate your room before you contribute</a></p>

<details>  
<summary>Example&nbsp;: Over-contributing to multiple accounts</summary>

<p>Isla, an 18-year-old resident of Canada, opens her first TFSA in  February 2022 with Rose Bank.</p>
<p>The TFSA annual dollar limit is $6,000 for 2022. Isla&rsquo;s contribution  room for 2022 is $6,000. She contributes <strong>$6,000 </strong>to this TFSA.</p>
<p>In September of the same year, Isla opens a second TFSA with Tropical  Bank and contributes <strong>$6,000</strong> to this TFSA.</p>
<p>Her contributions for that year add up as follows: $6,000 + $6,000 = <strong>$12,000</strong>.</p>
<p>Since her available contribution room for all her TFSAs combined was  $6,000, Isla has over-contributed.</p>
<p>Isla is signed up for email notifications in her CRA account. In May  2023, she receives a warning letter from the CRA in her CRA account about the  excess amount.  She reads the letter and  removes the excess amount from her TFSA. Because of her quick action, Isla avoids  paying tax on her overcontribution.</p>
<p>Now Isla keeps records of her contributions for all of her TFSAs and  makes sure the total is within her available contribution room.</p>

</details>

<h3>Do direct transfers through your TFSA issuer </h3>
<p>If you withdraw your  own funds and re-contribute them to another TFSA, you may unintentionally  over-contribute to the TFSA. If you are transferring funds from one TFSA to  another, always do a direct transfer through your financial institution to  avoid tax implications.</p>
<p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/requesting-a-tfsa-transfer.html#toc2">Avoid doing your own  transfers</a></p>

<h3>Option to give  to your spouse or common-law partner</h3>
<p>The total contribution you make to your own TFSA  cannot be more than your available contribution room. <br>
  However, you can give your spouse or common-law  partner money so that they can contribute to their own TFSA. This amount or any  income earned from this amount will not be allocated back to you.<br>
  The total contribution that your spouse or  common-law partner makes cannot be more than their available contribution room. <br>
