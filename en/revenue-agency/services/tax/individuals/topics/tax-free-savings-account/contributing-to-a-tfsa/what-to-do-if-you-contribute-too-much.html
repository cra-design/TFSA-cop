                            <h3 id="toc2">How we notify you of an excess amount</h3>
                            <p>The CRA may notify you if you have over-contributed to your TFSA and advise you of the potential tax implications. We send this notification to some TFSA holders through their <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/cra-login-services.html">CRA&nbsp;account</a> or by mail in late spring, after we are informed of the excess by the financial institution. </p>
                            <p>Whether you receive a notification or not, you will be required to file a TFSA Return for the excess amount. If you do not file a TFSA Return, you may receive a TFSA notice of assessment (NOA) later in the summer. </p>

                            <summary>How TFSA issuers update the CRA</summary>
                            <p>TFSA issuers must submit a summary of all the transactions that a holder makes in a calendar year by the end of February of the next calendar year.</p>
                            <p>It is therefore possible for your TFSA to have an excess amount for several months before you are  notified about it.</p>
                            <p>It is important to  keep and maintain your own records, and to track your contributions  closely. You should withdraw any excess amount  as soon as possible to minimize penalties.</p>

                            <h3>If you are a non-resident</h3>
                            <p>The CRA will send TFSA holders who are non-residents a  notice of assessment (NOA) that details the excess amount in their account. It will show  when the excess amount began, how long it was in the account and the date we  processed the NOA.</p>
                            <p>If applicable, the  NOA will also provide a detailed calculation of the tax that you owe on  contributions made to your TFSA while you were not a resident of Canada.</p>
