<p>Your contribution room is the maximum amount you can contribute to your Tax-free Savings Account (TFSA). It is specific to you and can change each year, as well as when you make TFSA contributions and withdrawals.</p>

<p>If you have more than one TFSA, your contribution room is the <strong>total</strong> that you can contribute to all your accounts collectively. </p>

  <p>David turned 40 in 2023 and became a resident of Canada the same year. In November of 2023, he received an inheritance and contributed $88,000 to a newly opened TFSA. He believed he was entitled to the total annual TFSA dollar limit since the program began in 2009.</p>
  <p>David did not know that the dollar limit only applies to him for the years he was a resident of Canada. Because David only became a resident of Canada in 2023, he only has $6,500 of available contribution room (the dollar limit for 2023).</p>

<p>If you are a resident of Canada, your contribution room starts to accumulate when you turn 18 years of age. This is when the <a href="#toc22">annual TFSA dollar limit</a>, which is set by the Government, becomes available to you as contribution room.</p>

<h4 class="h6">2023</h4>
<p>Joe is a resident of Canada. When he turned 18 years of age in 2023, he opened a TFSA.</p>
<p>The dollar limit was $6,500 in 2023 and Joe contributed the full amount. As a result, his contribution room was $0 for the rest of 2023.</p>

<h4 class="h6">2024</h4>
<p>In 2024, the new annual dollar limit was $7,000, so Joe now had $7,000 in available contribution room. But Joe had less money to invest this year and contributed only $2,000. This left him with an available contribution room of $5,000 for the rest of 2024.</p>

<h3>Contributions reduce your available room</h3>
<p>Any amount you contribute during the year <strong>reduces</strong> your remaining available contribution room in the <strong>same</strong> year.</p>

<p>If you contribute more than your available contribution room, it is an over-contribution and is taxable at a rate of 1% per month.</p>

<h3>Withdrawals are added back the next year</h3>
<p>Any amount you withdraw during the year will be <strong>added back</strong> as available contribution room  the <strong>next</strong> calendar year on January 1.</p>

<h3>Fees do not affect your room</h3>

<p>Any TFSA management fees that you may have to pay, as well as any fees paid by a TFSA trust (such as for investment counsel) do not affect your available contribution room.</p>


<h2 id="toc3">Types of permitted TFSA investments</h2>

<p>The types of investments that are permitted in a TFSA are generally the same as those permitted in an RRSP. They include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cash</li>
    <li>Mutual funds</li>
    <li>Securities listed on a designated stock exchange</li>
    <li>Guaranteed investment certificates</li>
    <li>Bonds</li>
    <li>Certain shares of small business corporations</li>
</ul>

<p>Investments that are <strong>not</strong> permitted include any investment that is or becomes prohibited, non-qualified or that has an advantage. Non-permitted TFSA investments are taxable.</p>

<h3>How some investments can affect your TFSA</h3>

<h4>Value of investment has no impact</h4>

<p>Changes in the value of your TFSA investments do <strong>not</strong> affect your contribution room.  Any earnings you make from your TFSA do not decrease your contribution room. Likewise, any losses you have do not increase your contribution room.</p>

<details>
<summary>Example: Investment earnings do not affect contribution room</summary>

<p>Brayden was eager to open his TFSA, but he didn’t turn 18 until December 21, 2023.</p>
<h5 class="h6">2024 </h5> 
<p>On January 4, 2024, he opened a TFSA. His available contribution room was $13,500 (the combined maximum TFSA dollar limits for 2023 and 2024).</p>

<h4>Watch exchange rates of foreign funds</h4>

<p>You may contribute foreign funds to a TFSA. However, when your financial institution reports the information to us, they will convert the funds to Canadian dollars using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. The total amount of your TFSA contribution in Canadian dollars must not be more than your available contribution room. </p>

<h4>If you have a self-directed TFSA</h4>
<p>You may move some investments that you already have into your self-directed TFSA, but it is not always recommended. </p>

<h5 class="h6" id="rrsp">Do not transfer from your RRSP </h5>
<p>A transfer from your RRSP counts as income. If you transfer RRSP investments to your TFSA, you are considered to have withdrawn the investment from your RRSP at the <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#fairmarketvalue">fair market value (FMV)<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a>.  This can have serious tax consequences.</p> 
<p>Because the withdrawal counts as income, you must report it in your Income Tax and Benefit Return for that year. You may claim the tax withheld on the withdrawal at line 43700 of your return. </p>
<p>The amount of the contribution will be the FMV of the investment at the time of the contribution. So if you transfer the amount some time after the withdrawal, the FMV may have changed. </p>
   
<p>When an exchange is between two registered accounts (such as an RRSP and a TFSA), you cannot usually exchange securities for cash or for other securities of equal value.</p>
                            
<h5 class="h6">In-kind contributions must be qualified</h5>
<p>You may make in-kind contributions if they are <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#qualifiedinvestment">qualified investments<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a>.</p>
<details>
<summary>What is an in-kind contribution</summary>                            
<p>An in-kind contribution is a seamless transfer of assets (without selling them first) from your regular portfolio (a non-registered account) to your TFSA. Qualified in-kind contributions may include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Guaranteed investment certificates </li>
    <li>Government and corporate bonds </li>
    <li>Mutual funds </li>
    <li>Securities listed on a designated stock exchange </li>
</ul>
</details>

<p>An in-kind contribution is considered disposed of at fair market value (FMV) at the time of the contribution. </p>
<ul>
    <li>If the FMV is <strong>more</strong> than the cost of the property, you must report the capital gain in your Income Tax and Benefit Return  </li>
    <li>If the FMV is <strong>less</strong> than the cost of the property, you cannot claim the capital loss </li>
</ul>
<p>The total amount of the contribution to your TFSA is equal to the FMV of the property. This contribution will immediately reduce your available contribution room by the same amount. </p>


                 
<h2 id="toc4">Do not contribute if you are a non-resident</h2>
<p>If you become a non-resident of Canada for income tax purposes, you <strong>cannot</strong> contribute to your TFSA tax-free. </p>

<p>If you make a non-resident contribution, except for a <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#qualifyingtransfer">qualifying transfer<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a> or an <a class="wb-lbx lbx-modal" href="#exemptcontribution">exempt contribution<span class="far fa-question-circle mrgn-lft-sm"></span></a>, you will be <strong>taxed at a rate of&nbsp;1%</strong> for each month the contribution remains in the account. You may also be liable for other taxes. </p>
