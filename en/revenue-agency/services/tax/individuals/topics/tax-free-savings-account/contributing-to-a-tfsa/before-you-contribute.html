<h2 id="toc1">What is contribution room</h2>
<p>Your contribution room is the maximum amount you can contribute to your TFSA. It is specific to you and changes over time, as well as when you make TFSA contributions and withdrawals.</p>

<p>If you have more than one TFSA, your contribution room is the total that you can contribute to all your accounts collectively. </p>
                
<h2 id="toc2">How contribution room accumulates</h2>
<p>If you are a resident of Canada, your contribution room starts to accumulate when you turn 18 years of age. This is when the <a href="#toc22">annual TFSA dollar limit</a>, which is set the by the Government, becomes available to you as contribution room.</p>

<p>If you are a new resident of Canada, you start to accumulate contribution room on the day you have residency.</p>

<p>If you are or become a non-resident who is 18 years of age or older and have a valid SIN, you may also accumulate contribution room, but it is not available to you (you cannot make any contributions) until you gain residency.</p>

<h2 class="h3" id="toc22">What is the annual TFSA dollar limit</h2>

<p>New contribution room becomes available every calendar year when the Government assigns the annual dollar limit. The dollar limit is the same for all TFSA holders and is set every January 1. You may contribute up to the full amount of the annual dollar limit each year tax-free if you have the available contribution room. You must not contribute more than your available room allows.</p>

<summary>Example: How contribution room changes</summary>

<p>Joe turned 18 in 2023 and opened a TFSA in the same year.</p>
<p>The dollar limit was $6,500 in 2023 and Joe contributed the full amount. As a result, his contribution room was zero for the rest of 2023.</p>

</div>  

<p>In 2024, the new annual dollar limit was $7,000, so Joe now had $7,000 in available contribution room. But Joe had less money to invest this year and contributed only $2,000. This left him with an available contribution room of $5,000 ($7,000 [minus] $2,000)for the rest of 2024. His unused contribution room is carried over to the next calendar year.</p>

<p>In 2025, the annual limit is $7,000. Joe’s new available contribution room is now $12,000 ($5,000 + $7,000). This is the maximum amount he can contribute in 2025.</p>

<h3>Other factors that affect contribution room</h3>

<h4>Contributions count against your available room</h4>

<p>Any contribution you make during the year immediately counts against your available contribution room. Meaning your contribution room will immediately decrease by the same amount that you contributed.</p>

<p>Any contribution you make over your available contribution room is an over-contribution and is taxable at a rate of 1% per month.</p>

<p>For more information:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributing-to-a-tfsa/how-to-contribute.html#toc2">How to avoid an over-contribution</a></li>

</ul> 

<h4>Withdrawals count towards next year's available room</h4>

<p>Any withdrawal you make during the calendar year is carried over to <strong>next year’s</strong> available contribution room. Meaning your contribution room will increase on January 1 of the next year by the same amount that you withdrew.</p>
<p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/withdrawing-from-a-tfsa.html#toc1">How withdrawals affect contribution room</a></p>



<h4>Fees do not affect your room</h4>

<p>Management fees that you may have to pay related to your TFSA trust do not affect your contribution room. Fees are not considered contributions to the TFSA. And paying for investment advice, transfers or other fees are not considered withdrawals.</p>


<h2 id="toc3">Types of permitted TFSA investments</h2>

<p>The types of investments that are permitted in a TFSA are generally the same as those permitted in a RRSP. They include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cash</li>
    <li>Mutual funds</li>
    <li>Securities listed on a designated stock exchange</li>
    <li>Guaranteed investment certificates</li>
    <li>Bonds</li>
    <li>Certain shares of small business corporations</li>
</ul>

<p>Investments that are not permitted include any investment that is or becomes prohibited, non-qualified or that has an advantage. Non-permitted TFSA investments are taxable.</p>

<p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/owing-tax-on-a-tfsa/if-you-have-non-permitted-investments.html">If you are taxed on non-permitted investments</a></p>

<h3>How investments may affect your TFSA</h3>

<h4>Investment value has no impact</h4>

<p>Changes in the value of your TFSA investments have no effect your TFSA contribution room.  Any earnings you make from your TFSA do not decrease your contribution room. Likewise, any losses you incur do not increase your contribution room.</p>

<details>
<summary>Example: Investment earnings do not affect contribution room</summary>

<p>Brayden was eager to open his TFSA, but he didn’t turn 18 until December 21, 2023.</p>

<p>On January 4, 2024, he opened a TFSA and contributed $13,500 ($6,500 for 2023 plus $7,000 for 2024 – the maximum TFSA dollar limits for those years). On the advice of his broker, he had opened a self‑directed TFSA and invested in stocks that increased in value.  </p>

<p>By the end of 2024, the value in Brayden’s TFSA had increased to $13,800. Brayden was worried that for 2025, he would only be able to contribute $6,700 (the TFSA dollar limit for 2025 less the $300 increase in value in his TFSA through 2024).  </p>

<p>Neither the earnings generated in the account nor the increase in its value will reduce the TFSA contribution room in the following year, so Brayden can contribute up to $7,000 in 2025 to his TFSA. </p>

</details>

 

<h4>Watch exchange rates of foreign funds</h4>

<p>You may contribute foreign funds to a TFSA. However, your issuer will convert the funds to Canadian dollars using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction when they report the information to us. The total amount of your TFSA contribution in Canadian dollars must not be more than your available contribution room. </p>

<p>If dividend income from a foreign country is paid to a TFSA, the dividend income may be subject to foreign withholding tax. </p>

 

<h4>In-kind contributions must be qualified</h4>

<p>You may only make “in kind” contributions if they are qualified investments. An “in-kind” contribution is a direct transfer of assets (without selling them first) from your regular portfolio (a non-registered account) to your TFSA. Qualified in-kind contributions may include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Money </li>
    <li>Guaranteed investment certificates </li>
    <li>Government and corporate bonds </li>
    <li>Mutual funds </li>
    <li>Securities listed on a designated stock exchange </li>
</ul>
 

<p>An in-kind contribution is considered disposed of at fair market value (FMV) at the time of the contribution. </p>
<ul>
    <li>If the FMV is more than the cost of the property, you must report the capital gain in your income tax return and benefit return  </li>
    <li>If the FMV is less than the cost of the property, you cannot claim the capital loss </li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of the contribution to your TFSA is equal to the FMV of the property.</p>

<h4>RRSP transfers count as income </h4>

<p>If you transfer investments from your RRSP to your TFSA, you are considered to have withdrawn the investment from the RRSP at the Fair Market value (FMV).  This withdrawal counts as income and must be reported in your Income tax and benefit return for that year. You may claim the tax withheld on the withdrawal at line 43700 of your return. </p>
<ul>
    <li>If the transfer happens immediately after the withdrawal, the same value will be used as the amount of the contribution to the TFSA </li>
    <li>If the transfer happens later, the amount of the contribution will be the FMV of the investment at the time of the contribution </li>
</ul>    

<p>When the exchange is between 2 registered accounts (such as a RRSP and a TFSA), you cannot usually exchange securities for cash or for other securities of equal value.>/
                 
<h2 id="toc4">Do not contribute if you are a non-resident</h2>
<p>If you become a non-resident for income tax purposes, do not contribute to your TFSA. </p>

<p>While contribution room does accumulate while you are a non-resident, it is not available to use. Contribution room is only available if you are a resident.  </p>

<p>Non-resident contributions will be taxed 1% for each month the contribution stays on the account.  You may also be liable for other taxes. </p>
