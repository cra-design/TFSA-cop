<h2 id="toc1">Save and invest tax-free</h2>
<p>The Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is a registered savings account that functions like an investment account. It can hold cash savings and investments that generate tax-free income.</p>

<p>TFSAs are overseen by the Government of Canada but administered by Canadian banks and financial institutions.</p>

<p>Any contribution you make to your TFSA and any income you earn through interest, dividends or capital gains is generally tax-free, even when you withdraw it. However, your contributions are not tax deductible because the money you contribute has already been taxed.</p>

<p>For more information: <a href="">Understand TFSA basics / Before you open</a></p>

<h2 id="toc2">Different types of TFSAs</h2>
<p>A TFSA can be a simple savings account or a more complex investment account.</p>
<h3>Managed TFSAs</h3>
<p>There are 3 main types of TFSAs you can open that are managed by your bank, insurance company, credit union, or trust company:</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal brdr-0">
      <dt>Deposit TFSA</dt>
      <dd>A high-interest/standard interest rate account held with a financial institution that works like a savings account or GIC</dd>
      <dt>Annuity contract</dt>
      <dd>An arrangement with an insurance company that offers guaranteed payments on a lump sum investment for a predetermined period of time, typically a locked-in retirement account (LIRA)</dd>
      <dt>Arrangement in trust</dt>
      <dd>An arrangement in which the financial institution acts as a trustee that holds your investments in trust for you (usually in a mutual fund account or a trading account)</dd>
    </dl>
                            
<!--<ul>
  <li><strong>Deposit TFSA</strong> – A high-interest/standard interest rate account held with a financial institution that works like a high-interest savings account or GIC</li>
  <li><strong>Annuity contract</strong> –  An arrangement with an insurance company that offers guaranteed payments on a lump sum investment for a predetermined period of time, typically a locked-in retirement account (LIRA) </li>
  <li><strong>Arrangement in trust</strong> – An arrangement in which the financial institution acts as a trustee that holds your investments in trust for you (usually in a mutual fund account or a trading account)</li>
</ul>-->
<p>Each type has its own features and risk levels. For more information about a certain type of TFSA, contact a TFSA issuer.</p>

<h3>A TFSA may be self-directed</h3>
<p>If you're comfortable managing your own investments, you can open a self-directed TFSA. This type of account lets you buy and sell qualified investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs.</p>

<p>Self-directed TFSAs are often used by experienced investors who want more control over their money's growth. For more information, contact a TFSA issuer.</p>
                            
<!--insert "basics" stepped list-->
<h2 id="toc3">How TFSAs work</h2>
<p>When you open a TFSA, it is important to understand the basics of how to manage your contributions and withdrawals.</p>
<!--stepped list here-->
 <ol class="lst-stps ld-zr">
      <!--<li>Open a TFSA with your financial institution</li>-->
      <li>You can contribute to your TFSA when you have available contribution room in your account (otherwise you'll be taxed)</li>
      <li>You can withdraw funds tax-free when you want</li>
     <li>You can re-contribute funds to your TFSA when you have enough available contribution room again</li>
    </ol>                           
<p>You may contribute to a TFSA at any time throughout the year. How much you are allowed to contribute will depend on how much <strong>available contribution room</strong> you have in your account.</p>
<p>For more information: <a href="">Understand contribution room</a></p>

<h2 id="toc4">TFSA impact on government benefits and credits</h2>
<p>Any income that you earn in your TFSA will not impact your federal income-tested benefits and credits. You can also withdraw funds from your TFSA at any time, for any reason, without affecting your eligibility for benefits and credits.</p>

<p>TFSAs have no effect on the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Old Age Security (OAS)</li>
  <li>Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)</li>
  <li>Employment Insurance (EI)</li>
</ul>

<p>Any income you earn or amounts you withdraw will also not affect your eligibility for the following federal credits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Canada Child Benefit (CCB)</li>
  <li>Canada Workers Benefit (CWB)</li>
  <li>Goods and Services Tax (GST) credit</li>
</ul>

<details>
  <summary>Example: TFSA impact on OAS and CPP benefits</summary>
  <p>Denis is retired. In addition to his pension, he receives OAS and CPP benefits. He earns $500 a year in interest income from his TFSA savings.</p>
  <p>Neither this income nor any TFSA withdrawals will affect any federal income-tested benefits or credits he receives, as they do not have to be included on his income tax and benefit return.</p>
  <p>If he had earned $500 in a regular savings account instead, it would have to be included on his income tax and benefit return. Denis would have to pay more tax and might have to repay some of his benefits.</p>
</details>
