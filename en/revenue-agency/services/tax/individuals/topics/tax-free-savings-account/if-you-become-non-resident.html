                        <p>A TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) holder who becomes a non-resident of Canada may continue to hold their TFSA. However, there are important rules and possible tax implications to consider.</p>

                <p>You are a non-resident for income tax purposes if you meet any of the following conditions:</p>

<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-xs">
      <li class="cnjnctn-col">

<p>You normally, customarily, or routinely live in another country and are not considered a resident of Canada</p>

<li class="cnjnctn-col">
<p>You do not have residential ties in Canada and one of the following applies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You live outside Canada throughout the year</li>  
    <li>You stay in Canada for less than 183 days in the tax year</li> 
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
                            
<p>Understanding your residency status is important in determining if you can contribute to your TFSA and if taxes may apply to contributions you make.</p>

<p>Even if you no longer live in Canada, you may have residential ties in Canada that are enough for you to be considered a factual or deemed resident of Canada. In these cases, the regular rules for holding or <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/opening-a-tfsa.html">opening a TFSA</a> still apply.</p>

    <li>a home in Canada </li>
    <li>a spouse or common-law partner or dependants in Canada </li>
    <li>personal property in Canada, such as a car or furniture </li>

<h2 id="toc2">Tax implications for non-resident TFSA holders</h2>

<h3>You may keep your TFSA</h3>

<p>If you become a non-resident, you are allowed to keep your existing TFSA. Any income you earn in your account, such as interest, dividends, or capital gains, will not be taxed in Canada.</p>

<p>However, you will <strong>not accumulate</strong> any new available contribution room for any year in which you are a non-resident for the entire year. Contribution room created as a result of a non-resident withdrawal will only become available when you regain residency.  The annual dollar limit is not pro-rated in the year you emigrate or immigrate. 

<details>
<summary>Example: How non-residency affects your contribution room</summary>

<h4 class="h6">2019 and 2020</h4>

<p>Daniel turned 18 in 2019 and opened a TFSA. He contributed the maximum amount he was allowed to that year ($6,000) and did the same in 2020 ($6,000). In September 2020, he moved to the U.K.  and became a non-resident of Canada.</p>

<h3>You may withdraw from your TFSA </h3>

<p>As a non-resident, you may withdraw funds from your TFSA without being taxed. However, the contribution room created from a non-resident withdrawal will <strong>only</strong> become available when you establish residency again.</p>

 
<details>
<summary>Example: How a non-resident withdrawal affects contribution room </summary>

<p>You withdraw $5,000 from your TFSA when you are a non-resident. The next calendar year, $5,000 will be added back to your contribution room, but it will not be available to you until you become a resident of Canada again.</p> 

</details>

 
<h3>Do not contribute to your TFSA </h3>

<p>Only residents of Canada may contribute to their TFSA tax-free. You can contribute to your TFSA up to the date that you become a non-resident. After that it will be considered a <strong>taxable</strong> non-resident contribution.</p>

<details>
<summary>How non-resident contributions are taxed </summary> 

<p>Any non-resident contribution you make, except for a qualifying transfer or an exempt contribution, is subject to a <strong>1% tax</strong> for each month the contribution remains in the account. This tax continues to apply until you withdraw the non-resident contribution or you become a resident of Canada again. </p>

<p>You will receive a notice of assessment for any non-resident contribution you make. </p>

<p>If the non-resident contribution also exceeds your available TFSA contribution room, you may be subject to an additional 1% monthly tax on the excess amount. </p>

<p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/owing-tax-on-a-tfsa/if-you-have-excess-contributions.html">If you are taxed on excess amounts </a></p>

<h2 id="toc3">If you are a non-resident beneficiary of a TFSA</h2>

<p>If you are a non-resident and are named as a beneficiary of a TFSA, there are possible tax implications.  </p>

<p>There are two types of beneficiaries:  </p>
<ul>
    <li>Successor holder</li>  
    <li>Designated beneficiary</li> 
</ul>
 

<h3>Non-resident successor holder </h3>

<p>A successor holder is the survivor of the deceased who is named as the new holder of the TFSA in the TFSA contract or will of the deceased holder.   </p>

<p>Non-resident successor holders who do not have a social insurance number (SIN) should apply for an individual tax number (ITN). </p>

<p>To apply for an ITN: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1261.html">Application for a CRA Individual Tax Number (ITN) for Non-Residents (Form T1261)</a>.</p>

<p>Non-resident successor holders cannot make contributions to the TFSA while they are non-resident. However, they may withdraw funds at any time.  </p>

<p>For more information about successor holders and possible tax implications, refer to <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/when-a-tfsa-holder-dies/if-you-are-a-successor-holder-of-a-tfsa.html">If you are a successor holder</a>. </p>

  

<h3>Non-resident designated beneficiary </h3>

<p>A designated beneficiary may be a survivor, family member, or other person or organization named as a beneficiary of the TFSA in the TFSA contract or will of the deceased holder.  </p>

<p>A non-resident designated beneficiary of a TFSA trust may receive a payment in cash or in kind based on the fair market value (FMV) of the TFSA on the date of death.  </p>

<p>However, the designated beneficiary must report payment amounts they receive during the exempt period that are above the FMV of the TFSA.  Any amounts received are subject to non-resident withholding tax.  </p>

<p>You can report these amounts to the CRA using the following: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/nr4.html">Statement of Amounts Paid or Credited to Non-Residents of Canada (Form NR4)</a>.</p>
