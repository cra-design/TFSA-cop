  <h3>Review the effect of Cedric’s contributions and withdrawals</h3>

  <p>From 2013 until the end of 2021, Cedric contributed the maximum TFSA dollar amount each year to his TFSA.</p>

  <p>In 2022, the TFSA dollar limit is $6,000 and Cedric contributes $2,000 for that year. He now has an available/unused TFSA contribution room of $4,000 calculated as below:</p>

  <table class="table table-bordered">
    <caption>2022 available room after contribution</caption>
    <tr>
    <td>2022 TFSA dollar limit</td>
    <td class="text-right">$6,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>2022 contributions</td>
    <td class="text-right"><span class="h2">-</span> <span class="wb-inv"> minus </span> $2,000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Available/Unused TFSA contribution room available for future years</td>
    <td class="text-right"><span class="h2">=</span> <span class="wb-inv"> equals </span> $4,000</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>In 2023 Cedric makes a $500 withdrawal from his account. Even though he makes this withdrawal in 2023, it will not be added back to his TFSA contribution room until 2024.</p>

  <table class="table table-bordered">

  <h2 id="toc2">How to make a withdrawal</h2>

  <p>To withdraw funds from your TFSA, contact the financial institution that issued it. Depending on the type of investments you hold, you can generally make a withdrawal any time during the year.</p>

  <p>Your TFSA issuer will report all the withdrawals you make in a year to the CRA. Your issuer will compile them into one report and usually send it by the end of February the next year. The CRA then adjusts your available contribution room for the new calendar year.</p>

  <h3>When to repay a withdrawal</h3>

  <p>You may replace or repay TFSA withdrawals you make by re-contributing the amounts you took out, but only if you have the available contribution room.</p>

  <p>The amount you withdraw will only be added back to your account as available contribution room the next calendar year. Unless you have the available room, you should not withdraw and repay in the same year.</p>

  <p>Always check that you have enough unused contribution room available before you contribute.</p>

  <p>We recommend that you calculate your available room yourself using your own records.</p>

  <p>For more information: Calculate your room before you contribute</p>

  <h4>Excess amounts are taxable</h4>

  <p>If you replace a withdrawal and do <strong>not</strong> have the available room, it is considered an over-contribution. The excess amount in your TFSA is taxable at a rate of 1% per month for as long as the excess amount remains in your account.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Example of withdrawing and repaying in the same year</summary>

  <h4>Repaying too soon can lead to an over-contribution</h4>

  <p>Since opening her TFSA in 2009, Twyla has contributed the maximum TFSA dollar limit each year. At the end of 2023, she has no available TFSA contribution room left.</p>

  <p>In 2024, Twyla makes a $7,000 contribution (the annual TFSA dollar limit for 2024).</p>

  <p>Later that year, she withdraws $3,000 for a trip.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, her plans change and she cannot go. She decides to re-contribute the $3,000 she withdrew.</p>

  <p>Twyla does not realize that if she returns any of the withdrawn amount before 2025, she will have an excess amount in her TFSA and will be charged a tax equal to 1% of the highest excess TFSA amount for each month that the excess stays in her account. This is because any withdrawal amount will only be added back to her contribution room the following calendar year.</p>
</details>

  <p>For more information: <a href="">If you over-contribute to a TFSA</a></p>

  <h2 id="toc3">Withdrawing as a non-resident</h2>

  <p>You may still withdraw money from your TFSA tax-free if you become a non-resident. But you <strong>cannot replace</strong> any withdrawals while you are a non-resident.</p>

  <p>Any repayment or re-contribution would be considered a non-resident contribution. This would be taxable at a rate of 1% per month for as long as the contribution remained in the account.</p>

  <p>After you withdraw money, new available contribution room will be added back to your account the next calendar year, however that contribution room is <strong>not available</strong> to you until you become a resident again.</p>
