                            <p>A prohibited investment can be any investment that a TFSA  trust acquires that is closely connected to the TFSA holder. TFSA investments  must be at <u>arm&rsquo;s length</u>&nbsp;&nbsp; from the holder.<br>
                              For example, if your TFSA has an investment in a company  in which you have shares or a partnership, you would be considered close to it  and not at arm&rsquo;s length.<br>

                              Review  the legal definition &lt;xh&gt; <br>
                              A prohibited investment for a registered plan is defined  in subsection 207.01(1) as any of the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>a debt of the controlling individual  of the plan</li>
                              <li>a debt or share of, or an interest  in, a corporation, trust or partnership in which the controlling individual has  a significant interest (see ¶2.6 to 2.15)</li>
                              <li>a debt or share of, or an interest  in, a person or partnership with which the controlling individual does not deal  at arm&rsquo;s length</li>
                              <li>an interest (or for civil law a  right) in, or a right to acquire, a debt, share or interest described in any of  the preceding bullets</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Tax you may owe on prohibited investments [heading  updated from &lsquo;tax you may owe&rsquo;] </h3>
                            <p>If at any time in the calendar year your investment is or  becomes prohibited, it is taxable at 50%  of the fair  market value (FMV) &nbsp;of the investment. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                              To calculate the amount you owe, complete and submit a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc243.html">TFSA Return (RC243)</a>, including &ldquo;Part D – Tax on prohibited investments&rdquo;. <br>
                              In certain circumstances, the 50% tax may be  refundable. <strong>[link below to anchor h3 Refund on  prohibited investment...]</strong><br>
                              Regardless of when the prohibited investment was  acquired, the TFSA holder is also liable for the 100% advantage tax on any  income the investment earned or capital gains it realized. <br>
                              For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/owing-tax-on-a-tfsa/if-you-have-non-permitted-investments.html#toc4">How an advantage is  taxed</a> <br>
                              If the investment stops being prohibited when it is held  by the TFSA trust, the trust is considered to have disposed of the prohibited  investment and immediately re-acquired it as a permitted investment at FMV.</p>
                            <h3>If your investment is also non-qualified </h3>
                            <p>If an investment is both prohibited and non-qualified,  the CRA treats it like a prohibited investment.<br>
                              For information:  <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/owing-tax-on-a-tfsa/if-you-have-non-permitted-investments.html#toc3">How non-qualified  investments are taxed</a></p>
                            <p>Refund on  prohibited investment tax&nbsp; <strong>[h3  anchor for <em>50% link</em> (above). This h3 updated frm &lsquo;claiming a refund...&rsquo;]</strong><br>
                              You may be able to get a refund of the 50% tax on a  prohibited investment if the investment was disposed of, or stopped being  prohibited, <strong>before the end</strong> of the calendar year that follows the year it  was taxed (or a later time permitted by the Minister of National Revenue).&nbsp; </p>
                            <p>We will not issue a refund if it is reasonable to expect  the holder knew, or should have known, that the investment was or would become  prohibited.<br>
                              If the tax and the entitlement to the refund happen in  the <strong>same calendar year</strong>, then you don't have to pay the tax. For example,  if the TFSA trust acquired and disposed of a prohibited investment in the same year, then you don't have any tax owing on  it. </p>
                            <p>How  to request a refund&lt;xh&gt; <br>
                              To request a refund of the 50% tax on a prohibited  investment, send us a written request for a refund when you submit your TFSA  Return (RC243). <br>
                              Be sure to attach documents that detail when the  investment was acquired and disposed of, including:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Name and description of the  investment</li>
                              <li>Number of shares or units</li>
                              <li>Date the investment was acquired or  became non-qualified or prohibited</li>
                              <li>Date of the investment was disposed  of or became qualified not prohibited</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you disposed of the prohibited investment<strong>in  the same year</strong> you acquired it, enter the refundable amount on the line in  Section 2 of the TFSA Return and attach documents.</p>
                            <p>The refund only applies to the 50% tax on prohibited  investments, not the 100% tax on advantages. <br>

                            <p>A TFSA that is set up as a trust must limit its  investments to qualified investments, such as mutual funds and other investment  products that are provided by the TFSA issuer.</p>
                            <p>Qualified investments include the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>money, GICs and other deposits</li>

                            <p>If a TFSA trust acquires a non-qualified investment, or  if an investment becomes non-qualified, it will be taxed. The investment is  taxable at 50% of the fair market value (FMV)&nbsp; of the investment at the time it was acquired or became  non-qualified.  <br>

                            <p>You may be able to get a refund of the 50% tax on a  non-qualified investment if the investment was disposed or, or stopped being  non-qualified, <strong>before the end</strong> of the calendar year that follows the year  it was taxed (or a later time permitted by the Minister of Nat Rev).  <br>
                              We will not issue a refund if it is reasonable to expect  the holder knew, or should have known, that the investment was or would become  non-qualified.<br>
                              If the tax and the entitlement to the refund happen in  the same calendar year, then you don't have to pay the tax. For example, if the  TFSA trust acquired and disposed of a non-qualified investment in the same  year, then  you don't have any tax owing on it.&nbsp; <br>
                              How  to request a refund&lt;xh&gt;  <br>
                              To request a refund of the 50% tax on a non-qualified  investment, send us a written request for a refund when you submit your TFSA  Return (RC243). Be sure to attach documents that detail when the investment was  acquired and disposed of, including:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Name and description of the  investment </li>
                              <li>Number of shares or units </li>
                              <li>Date the investment was acquired or  became non-qualified or prohibited </li>
                              <li>Date of the investment was disposed  of or became qualified not prohibited </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you disposed of the non-qualified investment in the  same year you acquired it, enter the refundable amount on the line in Section 2  of the TFSA Return and attach documents.<br>
                              The refund only applies to the 50% tax on non-qualified  investments, and not the 100% tax on advantages. <br>

                            <p>TFSA issuers must take care to minimize the possibility  that a TFSA trust holds non-qualified investments. If the issuer fails to do  this, they may face a penalty under the <em>Income Tax Act</em>.<br>
                              The issuer must also notify the holder before March of a  calendar year if the TFSA trust acquired or disposed of a non-qualified  investment, or if an investment became or stopped being non-qualified.&nbsp; </p>
                            <h2>How an advantage is taxed </h2>
                            <h3>What is an advantage </h3>
                            <p>An advantage is  any benefit or debt that is conditional on the existence of the TFSA, subject  to certain exceptions for normal investment activities and conventional  incentive programs. <br>
                              Review  what a benefit advantage may include &lt;xh&gt;<br>
                              An  advantage can include any benefit that is an increase in the total fair market  value (FMV) of the property of the TFSA that is reasonably attributable to any  one of the following: </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>a transaction or event (or series)  that would not have occurred in a normal commercial or investment context  between arm&rsquo;s length parties acting prudently, knowledgeably, and willingly,  and one of the main purposes of which is to benefit from the tax-exempt status  of the TFSA </li>
                              <li>a payment received in substitution  for a payment for services rendered by the holder (or non-arm&rsquo;s length person)  or for a return on investment on non-registered property </li>
                              <li>a swap transaction </li>
                              <li>specified non-qualified investment  income that has not been paid from the TFSA within 90 days of the holder  receiving a notice from CRA requiring removal </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>An advantage also includes any benefit that is income or  a capital gain that is reasonably attributable to one of the following: </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>a prohibited investment </li>
                              <li>a deliberate over-contribution to a  TFSA </li>

                              <li>an increase in the FMV of the property held in connection with the  plan which increase is reasonably attributable to certain transactions or  amounts (see ¶3.16 to 3.26)</li>
                              <li>income or a capital gain that is reasonably attributable to certain  property or transactions in respect of the plan (see ¶3.28 to 3.31)</li>
