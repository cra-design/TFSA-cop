                            <p>A prohibited investment can be any investment that a TFSA  trust acquires that is closely connected to the TFSA holder. TFSA investments  must be at arm&rsquo;s length from the holder.</p>
                              <p>For example, if your TFSA has an investment in a company  in which you have shares or a partnership, you would be considered close to it  and not at arm&rsquo;s length.</p>

                            <h3>Tax you may owe on prohibited investments</h3>
                            <p>If at any time in the calendar year your investment is or  becomes prohibited, it will be <strong>taxable at 50%</strong>  of the fair  market value (FMV) of the investment.</p>
                              <p>To calculate the amount you owe, complete and submit a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc243.html">TFSA Return (RC243)</a>, including &ldquo;Part D – Tax on prohibited investments&rdquo;.</p>
                       <p>If the investment stops being prohibited when it is held  by the TFSA trust, the trust is considered to have disposed of the prohibited  investment and immediately re-acquired it as a permitted investment at FMV.</p>
                      
                              <p>In certain circumstances, the 50% tax on prohibited investments <a href="#toc12">may be  refundable</a>.</p>
                              <p>If the prohibited investment earns any income or has capital gains, you will also be liable for the <strong>100% advantage tax</strong>.</p>

                            <p>If an investment is both prohibited and non-qualified,  the CRA will treat it like a prohibited investment.<br>
                              For information:  <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/owing-tax-on-a-tfsa/if-you-have-non-permitted-investments.html#toc2">How non-qualified  investments are taxed</a></p>
                            <h3 id="toc12">Refund on  prohibited investment tax</h3>
                              <p>You may be able to get a refund of the 50% tax on a  prohibited investment if the investment was disposed of, or stopped being  prohibited, <strong>before the end</strong> of the calendar year that follows the year it  was taxed (or a later time permitted by the Minister of National Revenue).</p>
                            <p>We will not issue a refund if it is reasonable to expect  the holder knew, or should have known, that the investment was or would become  prohibited.</p>
                              <p>If the tax on the prohibited investment and the entitlement to the refund happen in  the <strong>same calendar year</strong>, then you do not have to pay the tax. For example,  if the TFSA trust acquired and disposed of a prohibited investment in the same year, then there is no tax owing on  it. </p>

                              <p>To request a refund of the 50% tax on a prohibited  investment, send us a written request for a refund when you submit your TFSA  Return (RC243).</p>
                              <p>Be sure to attach documents that detail when the  investment was acquired and disposed of, including:</p>

                            <p>If you disposed of the prohibited investment <strong>in the same year</strong> you acquired it, enter the refundable amount on the line in  Section 2 of the TFSA Return and attach documents.</p>
                            <p>The refund only applies to the 50% tax on prohibited  investments, not the 100% tax on advantages.</p>

                            <p>If an investment is both non-qualified and prohibited,  the CRA will treat it like a prohibited investment.</p>
                            <p>For more information: <a href="https://cra-design.github.io/TFSA-cop/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/owing-tax-on-a-tfsa/if-you-have-non-permitted-investments.html#toc2">How prohibited  investments are taxed</a></p>

                            <h3 id="toc22">Refund on non-qualified investment tax</h3>
                            <p>You may be able to get a refund of the 50% tax on a  non-qualified investment if the investment was disposed or, or stopped being  non-qualified, <strong>before the end</strong> of the calendar year that follows the year  it was taxed (or a later time permitted by the Minister of Nat Rev).  </p>
                              <p>We will not issue a refund if it is reasonable to expect  the holder knew, or should have known, that the investment was or would become  non-qualified.</p>
                              <p>If the tax  on the non-qualified investment and the entitlement to the refund happen in  the same calendar year, then you don't have to pay the tax. For example, if the  TFSA trust acquired and disposed of a non-qualified investment in the same  year, then there is no tax owing on it.</p>

                            <h3>What is an advantage </h3>
                            <p>TFSA holders must avoid investments or transactions that are structured in way to artificially shift value into or out of the TFSA or result in certain advantages. An advantage can be a benefit or a debt that is conditional on the existence of the TFSA, subject  to certain exceptions for normal investment activities and conventional  incentive programs.</p>

                              <p> An  advantage can include any benefit that is an increase in the total fair market  value (FMV) of the property of the TFSA that is reasonably attributable to any  one of the following:</p>

                              <li>a transaction or event (or series)  that would not have occurred in a normal commercial or investment context  between arm&rsquo;s length parties acting prudently, knowledgeably, and willingly,  and one of the main purposes of which is to benefit from the tax-exempt status  of the TFSA </li>
                              <li>a payment received in substitution  for a payment for services rendered by the holder (or non-arm&rsquo;s length person)  or for a return on investment on non-registered property </li>
                              <li>a swap transaction </li>
                              <li>specified non-qualified investment  income that has not been paid from the TFSA within 90 days of the holder  receiving a notice from CRA requiring removal </li>

                            <p>An advantage also includes any benefit that is income or  a capital gain that is reasonably attributable to one of the following: </p>

                              <li>a prohibited investment </li>
