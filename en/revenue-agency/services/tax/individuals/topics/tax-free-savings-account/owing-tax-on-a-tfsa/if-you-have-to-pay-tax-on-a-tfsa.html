                            <p>If you think the CRA made a mistake  in your notice of assessment, you can  request a tax waiver or tax cancellation. This is often the fastest and easiest way to  resolve the issue.</p>
                            <p>The CRA may  waive or cancel all or part of the tax if we determine that it is fair to do  so. We will review your situation to determine if:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>the tax arose because of a reasonable  error</li>
                              <li>the extent to which the transaction(s) that lead to the tax also lead to another tax under the  Income Tax Act</li>
                              <li>the extent to which payments  have been made from your &nbsp;TFSA</li>
                            </ul>

<details>
                            <summary>What is a waiver or a cancellation</summary>
                             <p>A <strong>waiver </strong>is when the CRA grants a relief of  penalties and interest that you would otherwise have to pay before they are  assessed or charged to you.  It only  refers to tax paid under Part XI.01 of the Income Tax Act.</p>
                              <p>A <strong>cancellation </strong>is when the CRA grants a relief of  the penalties and interest that have already been assessed or charged to you.</p>
</details>
                            <h3 id="waivr">How to request a tax waiver or cancellation</h3>
                            <p>To request a waiver or cancellation of the tax, you must  send the CRA a letter that explains &nbsp;why the taxable situation  happened and why it would be fair to waive or cancel the tax. </p>
